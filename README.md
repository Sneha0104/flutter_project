A new Flutter project.

The link that guided me through the process:
https://medium.com/flutter-community/fetching-data-in-flutter-and-displaying-in-listview-ec1bb72af22c

I realized building from scratch and using api were new topics for me, since I have only worked on simple front-end flutter development for one day. 

I tried to change the UI according to the sample provided.

Things done:
1) I made tabs for today, week, month.
2) I used the api and got the data in the app.

Things not done:
1) I haven't filtered the news into today , week and month.
2) The image as well as the news url isn't clickable yet.
